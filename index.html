<h1>Online Learning</h1>


</ul><p>During the pandemic (Covid-19) season, many schools were closed due to the risk of spreading the virus. In doing so, majority of education providers resorted to <em>online learning</em>, where students will remain at home and learn normal school subjects online using platforms such as:
	zoom, google classroom and more. The impacts of online learning are seen in the world today. </p>
	
<p>Online Learning (<em>also known as e-learning, virtual learning, etc</em>) is the environment whereby individuals (such as students) learn school subjects and other subjects through online sources using internet connection. 
	It is not just students who can learn online, but rather other individuals who are keen to learn new things without having access to education resources, or are not able
	to enrol themselves in a educational course. In our case, we are focusing more on students because their schooling
	was affected by the impacts of Covid-19.</p>
