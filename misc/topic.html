<h1>Disadvantages of Online Learning</h1>

<p>Online learning have advanced in the field of computers in education and learning, helping to transform in-person courses into online and hybrid courses. Many thanks to the Universities and other educational institutions that have begun to adapt to the changing nature of the future.</p>

<p>As stated in which “ Online education is often done independently, which can make it more challenging to navigate, stay engaged and be motivated” (IU, 2023). In this research that follows, we’ll talk about the dangers that online learning poses to society</p>

<p> One of the problems with online learning is that there are a few factors which of are importance. Furthermore “One of the major disadvantages of online education can be the lack of physical interaction” (IU, 2023). Online learners miss out on the control over conversation flow that face-to-face meetings provide, the spontaneity of the in-the-moment interactions, the feeling of noticing and being perceived by others, and the sense of getting to know others on a deeper level.</p>

<p>It is a very interesting topic as we have abruptly experienced it without much warning prior Covid-19. As discussed in (IU, 2023) “Another drawback of online education is the difficulty in maintaining focus when you study on your own”. It is a problem that is extremely relevant if we think back to those times, when the majority of students experienced a drop in their average GPA as a result of skipping online-class and, in worst case scenario, falling papers. This might also be due to distractions that are more easily accessible at home than in an AUT environment.  </p>
