<h1>Disadvantages of Online Learning</h1>


<p>One of the problems with online learning is that there are a few factors which of are importance. Online learners miss out on the control over conversation flow that face-to-face meetings provide, the spontaneity of in-the-moment interactions, the feeling of noticing and being perceived by others, and the sense of getting to know others on a deeper level.</p>

<p>It is a problem that is extremely relevant if we think back to Covid-19, when the majority of students experienced a drop in their average GPA as a result of skipping online-class  and, in worst case scenario, failing papers. This might also be due to distractions that are more easily accessible at home than in an AUT environment.</p>

<p> For all courses, there should be a choice between hybrid online learning and attending in-person sessions in order to accommodate a wide range of students. This enables students to revisit earlier recordings to review specific content. </p>
