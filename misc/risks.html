<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>What are some risks that are presented by Online Learning?<p></h4>

<p>As we have discussed the advantages of online learning over traditional in-person education which may seem superior given it’s accessibility and simplicity. Unfortunately, it fails in a number of ways. There is a disagreement over whether or not online education is comparable to traditional lectures. </p>
<ul>
<li>As we’ve previously discussed, it’s important for students to be motivated and have effective time management skills. However, while this is a benefit, it can be difficult to keep students motivated when they are learning independently because there isn’t a set curriculum to follow or a set schedule. Consequently falling behind on course-work and possibly failing.</li>
	<p></p>
<li>Being exposed to the desktop monitor is inevitable so this could imply a prolonged screen time. This could result to several health problems including but not limited to eyesight, obesity, and mental health is also affected which could possibly lead to depression, and anxiety problems. According to (Npr, 2020) “A new study finds that sitting still is linked to a higher risk of depression among teens, but even an hour of light physical activity everyday reduces the risk of depression by 10%”. This demonstrates that it is a well-known problem that has been addressed in the past and studies have shown it has adverse effect on students particularly younger teens.</li>
	<p></p>
<li>Having the comfort of learning from home is great, but social isolation is also a major drawback that can have a negative effect. For instance, since school is where most young teens get their social interaction, a lack of physical interaction can hinder communication skills that students should be honing from a young age. According to (Prosperity, 2023), “Students attain theoretical knowledge at their convenience, but often their communication skills are neglected”. This prominently shows that the absence of face-to-face communication accounts from this study. It is almost certain that students might ultimately suffer from negative effects as a result of this.</li>
	<p></p>
<p>Given these risks, online learning has a long way to go before it can completely replace traditional learning, despite having some clear drawbacks. However, the majority of these issues can be resolved without much difficulty because it requires the student to have healthy breaks during online studying, as well as having a great discipline to carry them throughout on a daily basis.
