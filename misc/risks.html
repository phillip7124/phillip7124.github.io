<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>What are some risks that are presented by Online Learning?<p></h4>

<p>Were there is a positive, there is always a negative. Upon being exposed to the internet through online learning,
	students are able to create ways to cheat on online tests and assignments. Also being exposed to the internet, younger 
	students may be exposed to material that is not suitable for them to view. This a negative because they will not have
	the same experience of online learning as other students if they come in contact with the said non-suitable material.</p>
