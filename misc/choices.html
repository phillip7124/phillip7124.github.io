<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


<p>As you know, online learning was heavily introduced during Covid-19 and is still offered as an option in some courses by some educational providers. However, most if not all education providers have a better chance of using a combination of in-person and online learning. This allows students to spend time in class for necessary important lectures while other general lectures takes place online. It is beneficial if students who cannot attend on time have access to recorded lecture videos. As United States of America University puts it, “Hybrid courses offer the best of both online and face-to-face learning. And According to 33% of USA colleges this blended learning style is here to stay” Intercoast(2024). We should be able to learn a lot about the attempts of using hybrid learning from other Universities outside New Zealand and find a well balanced option for students overall. </p>
