<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


	</ul><h4><p>What are some opportunities that are presented by Online Learning?</p></h4>
	
<p>There are many opportunites presented by online learning such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are benefits that online learning brings to society, including the ability to be flexible and accommodate students’ schedules, especially if they have a part-me job. These benefits include the ability to choose when to study and watch online lectures based on the students’ schedules, which makes juggling course loads less stressful. This makes it possible to maintain a healthy balance between your personal and social life while still managing your studies. </li>
	<li>Better time management skills are a significant benefit of online learning. According to (Drexel, 2024), “Students still need to manage their time wisely to ensure they complete their assignment”. This implies that students have responsibilities beyond simply showing up for class on the designated day and time. As a result, they learn a lot from their coursework and develop their time-management skills.</li>
	<li>Additionally, despite learning remotely, this encourages self-discipline and help students stay motivated. This demonstrates that establishing clear, difficult goals will result in better performance. According to (Education, 2022), “Increases students’ motivation and achievement levels”. This demonstrates unequivocally that once a student sets a particular goal, they will eventually reap the benefits.</li>
	<li>Furthermore, lower cost in terms of having virtual course materials which could help reducing necessary costs of textbooks and course materials. Students will also save transportation expenses in the long run. </li>
